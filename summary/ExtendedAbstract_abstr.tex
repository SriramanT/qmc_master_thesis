\begin{abstract}
In this work, we focus on emerging edge-state magnetism in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides nanoribbons.
We consider a recently introduced symmetry-based tight-binding model, found to capture edge state-related properties of the system, and we generalize it to interacting case by considering intra-orbital Hubbard-type interactions.
Our approach to this problem is two-fold.
We start by performing original numerical mean field calculations and build an approximate physical picture of the system at hand.
Then, we use our own implementation of the unbiased, state-of-the-art Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate this interacting, quantum many-fermion system.
