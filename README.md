## 1. Introduction

In this chapter the goal is to motivate the work and expose clearly some fundamental concepts. I want to be vague, but not unclear. The underlying structure should guide the reader through the questions we are trying to answer with this work and throught the basic concepts required to understand the questions.

### **Emergence in condensed matter physics**


### **What are TMD nanoribbons and why are they interesting**


### **Electron correlations in TMD nanoribbons**


### **Dealing with correlations is hard**


### **The many-body problem consists of solving the Schr√∂dinger equation in a 3N-dimensional space**


### **The problem of computing expectations of observables may be reduced to calculating integrals in this high dimension space**


### **Monte Carlo sampling is an appropriate method to compute these integrals**


### **Classical vs Quantum Monte Carlo**


### **Outline**
