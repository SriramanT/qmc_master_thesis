The resulting model for a d-dimensional quantum system is a (d+1\}-dimensional Ising model with complicated interactions. The new transformation is particularly useful for performing numerical studies of these models using Monte Carlo techniques. We study its convergence properties and compare it with the usual Gaussian formulation for the case of the Hubbard model.},

	title = {Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation of the Attractive Hubbard Model in a Harmonic Confining Potential},
	abstract = {The low-temperature properties of the two-dimensional attractive Hubbard model strongly depend on the fermion density. This fact has fundamental consequences for experiments on ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices, where the magneto-optical trap, which is required experimentally, introduces an inhomogeneous confining potential, which in turn leads to an inho- mogeneous particle density œÅi. In the homogeneous (untrapped) case, away from half-filling, i.e.. at œÅ Ã∏= 1, there is a Kosterlitz-Thouless tran- sition at a critical temperature Tc {\textgreater} 0 to a superfluid phase exhibiting quasi-long-range pair order (qlro). However, at half-filling pair order is degenerate with charge-density-wave order for symmetry reasons; there- fore, the qlro is suppressed and the system orders only at T = 0, where it enters a phase exhibiting long-range order simultaneously in the pairing and charge-density-wave channels.
In this work, the two-dimensional attractive Hubbard model in a har- monic confining potential is studied using determinant quantum Monte Carlo. At low temperatures, we find large pair correlations; a comparison with the so-called local-density approximation shows that the latter makes drastically wrong predictions for the pairing and charge-density-wave correlation functions around half-filling. This means that a larger portion of the system than expected will be superfluid, but also that the physics of the half-filled attractive model is represented anywhere in the trap. Fur- thermore, in a finite-size extrapolation adapted to the confined case, we show evidence that a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to a superfluid qlro phase also occurs in the inhomogeneous case. The transition temperature is roughly estimated to be Tc ‚àº 0.15 t.},

	abstract = {The determinantal quantum Monte Carlo ({DQMC}) simulation of the Hub- bard model relies on a discrete Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation ({DHST}) to decouple the Fermion interaction on every lattice site and perform im- portance sampling over classical variables (also called Ising fields). How- ever, for regimes away from half-filling and inverse temperatures as low as ùõΩ = 4, the method suffers from the so-called Fermion sign-problem, where the transition probabilites in the simulation are not positive definite.
Trying to improve on the sign problem, a second Ising field is introduced on every lattice point in a one-parameter family of {DHSTs}. The aim of this thesis is to implement the original simulation proposed in [1] and extend it to the modified {DHST}. We show that our implementation is accurate as it is able to recover results obtained from exact calculations. Furthermore, we show that the choice of the free parameter in the transformation has an affect on the sign.
Due to constraints in computer power the results are not conclusive.},

These methods have allowed applications ranging from the study of strongly correlated models, such as the Hubbard model, to ab initio calculations in molecules and solids. The present package implements the full ground-state constrained-path Monte Carlo ({CPMC}) method in Matlab with a graphical interface, using the Hubbard model as an example. The package can perform calculations in finite supercells in any dimensions, under periodic or twist boundary conditions. Importance sampling and all other algorithmic details of a total energy calculation are included and illustrated. This open-source tool allows users to experiment with various model and run parameters and visualize the results. It provides a direct and interactive environment to learn the method and study the code with minimal overhead for setup. Furthermore, the package can be easily generalized for auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo ({AFQMC}) calculations in many other models for correlated electron systems, and can serve as a template for developing a production code for {AFQMC} total energy calculations in real materials. Several illustrative studies are carried out in one- and two-dimensional lattices on total energy, kinetic energy, potential energy, and charge- and spin-gaps.

To investigate this phenomenon, we study a minimal electronic model of {FeSe}, with interactions that enhance nematic fluctuations. This model is sign problem free, and is simulated using determinant quantum Monte Carlo ({DQMC}). We developed a {DQMC} algorithm with parallel tempering, which proves to be an efficient source of global updates and allows us to access the region of strong interactions. Over a wide range of intermediate couplings, we observe superconductivity with an extended s-wave order parameter, along with enhanced, but short-ranged, q=(0,0) ferro-orbital (nematic) order. These results are consistent with approximate weak-coupling treatments that predict that nematic fluctuations lead to superconducting pairing. Surprisingly, in the parameter range under study, we do not observe nematic long-range order. Instead, at stronger coupling an unusual insulating phase with q=(œÄ,œÄ) antiferro-orbital order appears, which is missed by weak-coupling approximations.},

	abstract = {The Hubbard-Stratonovitch auxiliary-field approach to projection of the ground state of an interacting fermion system from a trial state is examined. It is shown that the method is equivalent to solving a differential equation with diffusion, drift, and branching terms on the manifold of normalized Slater determinants. Explicit general expressions are given for the coefficients of the diffusion equation in terms of the Hubbard-Stratonovitch fields. The form of the equation is somewhat similar to that obtained in the continuum Green‚Äôs-function Monte Carlo method, although its interpretation and relation to the physical many-body problem is quite different. The character of the representation of the many-body ground state arising in the auxiliary-field projection approach is discussed within this framework. The diffusion process is normally found to concentrate the states representing the ground state near the classical mean-field solutions. The consequences of this picture of the auxiliary-field approach for the ‚Äò‚Äòfermion minus-sign‚Äô‚Äô problem in this context are discussed, and some conclusions are reached concerning the range of validity of a recently suggested approximation where minus signs are ignored.},

	abstract = {We discuss a new method to perform numerical simulations of one-dimensional systems with fermion and boson degrees of freedom. The method is based on a direct-space, imaginary-time representation of the fermion field. It is fast so that systems having up to 100 sites can easily be simulated. In addition, the method provides an intuitive physical "picture" of the ground state of a one-dimensional many-body system. We discuss in detail how to implement the method and how to compute various physical quantities. In particular, we show how to extend the method to study averages of off-diagonal quantities in an occupation-number representation. To assess the accuracy of our procedure, we apply it to free fermions in one dimension and compare with exact results. We then study a model of spinless interacting fermions and obtain the expected phase structure and behavior of correlation functions. We also consider the extended Hubbard model at various points in its phase diagram and study the behavior of spin-density, charge-density, and pairing correlation functions. We then study the Gross-Neveu model and show how the behavior depends on the number of fermion flavors. Finally, we consider an electron-phonon model and study its behavior both in the one-particle polaron sector and in the half-filled-band case. Along the way we show pictures of the ground-state configurations that give physical insight into the properties of the systems, like charge-density-wave, spin-density-wave, and superconducting states, "fractional charges," and solitons. We conclude by comparing our method with other methods and discuss the possibility of extending it to higher dimensions.},

The basic approach is to integrate out the fermion degrees of freedom and obtain an effective action for the boson fields to which standard Monte Carlo techniques can be applied. We study the structure of the effective action for a wide class of theories. We develop a procedure for making rapid calculations of the variation in the effective action due to local changes in the boson fields, which is essential for practical numerical calculations.},

	abstract = {We have studied the two-dimensional Hubbard model on a square lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping. We first discuss the properties of the model within the mean-field approximation: Because of the form of the band structure, some peculiar features are found. We then discuss the simulation algorithm used and compare simulation results with exact results for 6-site chains to test the reliability of the approach. We present results for thermodynamic properties and correlation functions for lattices up to 8√ó8 in spatial size. The system is found to be an antiferromagnetic insulator for all values of the coupling constant at zero temperature in the half-filled-band case, but the long-range order is much smaller than predicted by mean-field theory. We perform a finite-size-scaling analysis to determine the character of the transition at zero coupling. For non-half-filled-band cases, our results suggest that the system is always paramagnetic, in contradiction with Hartree-Fock predictions. The system does not show tendency to ferromagnetism nor triplet superconductivity in the parameter range studied. We also discuss some properties of the attractive Hubbard model in the half-filled-band case.},
