	abstract = {We study a new kind of ordering — topological order — in rigid states (the states with no local gapless excitations). We concentrate on characterization of the different topological orders. As an example we discuss in detail chiral spin states of 2 + 1 dimensional spin systems. Chiral spin states are described by the topological Chern-Simons theories in the continuum limit. We show that the topological orders can be characterized by a non-Abelian gauge structure over the moduli space which parametrizes a family of the model Hamiltonians supporting topologically ordered ground states. In 2 + 1 dimensions, the non-Abelian gauge structure determines possible fractional statistics of the quasi-particle excitations over the topologically ordered ground states. The dynamics of the low lying global excitations is shown to be independent of random spatial dependent perturbations. The ground state degeneracy and the non-Abelian gauge structures discussed in this paper are very robust, even against those perturbations that break translation symmetry. We also discuss the symmetry properties of the degenerate ground states of chiral spin states. We find that some degenerate ground states of chiral spin states on torus carry non-trivial quantum numbers of the 90° rotation.},

	abstract = {We perform projective quantum Monte Carlo simulations of zigzag graphene nanoribbons within a realistic model with long-range Coulomb interactions. Increasing the relative strength of nonlocal interactions with respect to the on-site repulsion does not generate a phase transition but has a number of nontrivial effects. At the single-particle level we observe a marked enhancement of the Fermi velocity at the Dirac points. At the two-particle level, spin- and charge-density-wave fluctuations compete. As a consequence, the edge magnetic moment is reduced but the edge dispersion relation increases in the sense that the single-particle gap at momentum q=π/{\textbar}a1{\textbar} grows. We attribute this to nonlocal charge fluctuations which assist the spin fluctuations to generate the aforementioned gap. In contrast, the net result of the interaction-induced renormalization of different energy scales is a constant spin-wave velocity of the edge modes. However, since the particle-hole continuum is shifted to higher energies—due to the renormalization of the Fermi velocity—Landau damping is reduced. As a result, a roughly linear spin-wave-like mode at the edge spreads out through a larger part of the Brillouin zone.},

To date, nanodots/nanoislands have been regularly observed, while controlled fabrication of {TMD} nanoribbons remains challenging. Here we report a bottom-up fabrication of {MoSe}2 nanoribbons using molecular beam epitaxy, via an unexpected temperature-induced morphological phase transition from the nanodot to nanoribbon regime. Such nanoribbons are of zigzag nature, characterized by distinct chemical and electronic properties along the edges. The phase space for nanoribbon growth is narrowly defined by proper Se:Mo ratios, as corroborated experimentally using different Se fluxes, and supported theoretically using first-principles calculations that establish the crucial role of the morphological reconstruction of the bare Mo-terminated edge. The growth mechanism revealed should be applicable to other {TMD} systems.},

Yet, topological superconductors are rare to date. Here we propose to realize spinless fermions by splitting the spin degeneracy in momentum space. Specifically, we identify monolayer hole-doped transition metal dichalcogenide ({TMD})s as candidates for topological superconductors out of such momentum-space-split spinless fermions. Although electron-doped {TMDs} have recently been found superconducting, the observed superconductivity is unlikely topological because of the near spin degeneracy. Meanwhile, hole-doped {TMDs} with momentum-space-split spinless fermions remain unexplored. Employing a renormalization group analysis, we propose that the unusual spin-valley locking in hole-doped {TMDs} together with repulsive interactions selectively favours two topological superconducting states: interpocket paired state with Chern number 2 and intrapocket paired state with finite pair momentum. A confirmation of our predictions will open up possibilities for manipulating topological superconductors on the device-friendly platform of monolayer {TMDs}.},

Characteristic enhancements in the magnetic correlations for distinct ribbon widths and chiralities are associated with energy gaps in the tight-binding limit of such ribbons.

	abstract = {The first, second, and third editions of this book seem to occur at ten year intervals. The intent is to keep the book up-to-date. Many-body theory is a field which continually evolves in time. Journals only publish new results, conferences only invite speakers to report new phenomena, and agencies only fund scientists to do new physics. Today's physics is old hat by tomorrow. Students want to learn new material, and textbooks must be modified to keep up with the times. The early chapters in this book teach the techniques of many-body theory. They are largely unchanged in format. The later chapters apply the techniques to specific problems. The third edition increases the number of applications. New sections have been added, while old sections have been modified to include recent applications. The previous editions were set in type using pre-computer technology. No computer file existed of the prior editions. The publisher scanned the second edition and gave me a disk with the contents. This scan recorded the words accurately and scrambled the equations into unintelligible form. So I retyped the equations using {LaTeX}. Although tedious, it allowed me to correct the infinite numbers of typographical errors in the previous edition. The earlier typesetting methods did not permit such corrections. The entire book was edited sentence-by­ sentence. Most old sections of the book were shortened by editing sentences and paragraphs.},

	abstract = {The behavior of the electrons in a dense electron gas is analyzed quantum-mechanically by a series of canonical transformations. The usual Hamiltonian corresponding to a system of individual electrons with Coulomb interactions is first re-expressed in such a way that the long-range part of the Coulomb interactions between the electrons is described in terms of collective fields, representing organized "plasma" oscillation of the system as a whole. The Hamiltonian then describes these collective fields plus a set of individual electrons which interact with the collective fields and with one another via short-range screened Coulomb interactions. There is, in addition, a set of subsidiary conditions on the system wave function which relate the field and particle variables. The field-particle interaction is eliminated to a high degree of approximation by a further canonical transformation to a new representation in which the Hamiltonian describes independent collective fields, with n′ degrees of freedom, plus the system of electrons interacting via screened Coulomb forces with a range of the order of the inter electronic distance. The new subsidiary conditions act only on the electronic wave functions; they strongly inhibit long wavelength electronic density fluctuations and act to reduce the number of individual electronic degrees of freedom by n′. The general properties of this system are discussed, and the methods and results obtained are related to the classical density fluctuation approach and Tomonaga's one-dimensional treatment of the degenerate Fermi gas.},

An exact formula for the constant C is given here for the first time; earlier workers had made only approximate calculations of C. Further, it is shown how the next correction in rs can be computed.

By a series of canonical transformations it is shown that under suitable circumstances (which obtain in nearly all solids) plasmons (a quantized collective plasma oscillation of the electron gas) represent a well-defined elementary excitation of the solid. The "existence criterion" for plasmons is found to be a high electronic polarizability. Where plasmons exist, we are able to give a satisfactory description of their properties when the majority of the individual electron oscillator strengths correspond to transitions in which the energy change is large or small with respect to the plasmon energy, \hbar \omega p=\hbar(4{ \pi N e}2m)12. After the plasmon modes are separated out, the remaining electron interaction is found to be screened, with a range of the order of the interelectronic spacing. The usefulness of this effective Hamiltonian for the calculation of the electronic energy levels and cohesive energy in solids is discussed briefly.},

	abstract = {Attention is drawn to a class of semi-conductors or insulators with incompletely filled 3d bands. Their lack of conductivity, if the number of electrons per atom is an integer, is explained by the circumstance that a moving electron will have a large probability of being withdrawn to the initial atom, if only the potential barriers to be penetrated are sufficiently high to reduce the frequency of transition below a certain limit. This inhibiting factor disappears, if for ions of equal electronic levels the number of electrons per atom differs from an integer. In the case of {NiO} this condition is fulfilled if an electron is brought by thermal excitation from the lattice 3d band into the somewhat raised and less occupied levels a, a' (figure 1); these levels belong to Ni ions adjacent to a vacant Ni lattice point introduced by the deviations from stoichiometry, and two of these Ni ions are at the absolute zero Ni3+ ions. An analogous conduction mechanism holds for non-stoichiometric Cu2O, with a completely filled 3d band (figure 2).
Photoconductivity is generally observed with substances with completely filled zones and never with substances of the {NiO} type. A tentative explanation is given for this fact on the basis of the model of figure 1 and figure 2.
In non-stoechiometric {ZnO} vacant oxygen lattice points are assumed (figure 3); in that case the calculation of the lattice levels shows that at the lattice holes one Zn2+ is converted into Zn, whereas in the lattice the additional electrons form Zn+ ions, as will be the case after thermal transitions of the electrons belonging to these Zn atoms into the lattice 4s band.},
