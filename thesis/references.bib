	abstract = {We study a new kind of ordering — topological order — in rigid states (the states with no local gapless excitations). We concentrate on characterization of the different topological orders. As an example we discuss in detail chiral spin states of 2 + 1 dimensional spin systems. Chiral spin states are described by the topological Chern-Simons theories in the continuum limit. We show that the topological orders can be characterized by a non-Abelian gauge structure over the moduli space which parametrizes a family of the model Hamiltonians supporting topologically ordered ground states. In 2 + 1 dimensions, the non-Abelian gauge structure determines possible fractional statistics of the quasi-particle excitations over the topologically ordered ground states. The dynamics of the low lying global excitations is shown to be independent of random spatial dependent perturbations. The ground state degeneracy and the non-Abelian gauge structures discussed in this paper are very robust, even against those perturbations that break translation symmetry. We also discuss the symmetry properties of the degenerate ground states of chiral spin states. We find that some degenerate ground states of chiral spin states on torus carry non-trivial quantum numbers of the 90° rotation.},

	abstract = {We perform projective quantum Monte Carlo simulations of zigzag graphene nanoribbons within a realistic model with long-range Coulomb interactions. Increasing the relative strength of nonlocal interactions with respect to the on-site repulsion does not generate a phase transition but has a number of nontrivial effects. At the single-particle level we observe a marked enhancement of the Fermi velocity at the Dirac points. At the two-particle level, spin- and charge-density-wave fluctuations compete. As a consequence, the edge magnetic moment is reduced but the edge dispersion relation increases in the sense that the single-particle gap at momentum q=π/{\textbar}a1{\textbar} grows. We attribute this to nonlocal charge fluctuations which assist the spin fluctuations to generate the aforementioned gap. In contrast, the net result of the interaction-induced renormalization of different energy scales is a constant spin-wave velocity of the edge modes. However, since the particle-hole continuum is shifted to higher energies—due to the renormalization of the Fermi velocity—Landau damping is reduced. As a result, a roughly linear spin-wave-like mode at the edge spreads out through a larger part of the Brillouin zone.},

To date, nanodots/nanoislands have been regularly observed, while controlled fabrication of {TMD} nanoribbons remains challenging. Here we report a bottom-up fabrication of {MoSe}2 nanoribbons using molecular beam epitaxy, via an unexpected temperature-induced morphological phase transition from the nanodot to nanoribbon regime. Such nanoribbons are of zigzag nature, characterized by distinct chemical and electronic properties along the edges. The phase space for nanoribbon growth is narrowly defined by proper Se:Mo ratios, as corroborated experimentally using different Se fluxes, and supported theoretically using first-principles calculations that establish the crucial role of the morphological reconstruction of the bare Mo-terminated edge. The growth mechanism revealed should be applicable to other {TMD} systems.},

Yet, topological superconductors are rare to date. Here we propose to realize spinless fermions by splitting the spin degeneracy in momentum space. Specifically, we identify monolayer hole-doped transition metal dichalcogenide ({TMD})s as candidates for topological superconductors out of such momentum-space-split spinless fermions. Although electron-doped {TMDs} have recently been found superconducting, the observed superconductivity is unlikely topological because of the near spin degeneracy. Meanwhile, hole-doped {TMDs} with momentum-space-split spinless fermions remain unexplored. Employing a renormalization group analysis, we propose that the unusual spin-valley locking in hole-doped {TMDs} together with repulsive interactions selectively favours two topological superconducting states: interpocket paired state with Chern number 2 and intrapocket paired state with finite pair momentum. A confirmation of our predictions will open up possibilities for manipulating topological superconductors on the device-friendly platform of monolayer {TMDs}.},

These correlations are accompanied by a dominant low-energy peak in the local spectral function and we propose that this can be used to detect edge-state magnetism by scanning tunneling microscopy. The dynamic spin structure factor at the edge of a ribbon exhibits an approximately linearly dispersing collective magnonlike mode at low energies that decays into Stoner modes beyond the energy scale where it merges into the particle-hole continuum.},

Our results show that for chiral ribbons of sufficient width, the spin correlations exhibit exceedingly long correlation lengths, even between zigzag segments that are well separated by periodic armchair regions. Characteristic enhancements in the magnetic correlations for distinct ribbon widths and chiralities are associated with energy gaps in the tight-binding limit of such ribbons.

They are largely unchanged in format. The later chapters apply the techniques to specific problems. The third edition increases the number of applications. New sections have been added, while old sections have been modified to include recent applications. The previous editions were set in type using pre-computer technology. No computer file existed of the prior editions. The publisher scanned the second edition and gave me a disk with the contents.

The usual Hamiltonian corresponding to a system of individual electrons with Coulomb interactions is first re-expressed in such a way that the long-range part of the Coulomb interactions between the electrons is described in terms of collective fields, representing organized "plasma" oscillation of the system as a whole. The Hamiltonian then describes these collective fields plus a set of individual electrons which interact with the collective fields and with one another via short-range screened Coulomb interactions. There is, in addition, a set of subsidiary conditions on the system wave function which relate the field and particle variables. The field-particle interaction is eliminated to a high degree of approximation by a further canonical transformation to a new representation in which the Hamiltonian describes independent collective fields, with n′ degrees of freedom, plus the system of electrons interacting via screened Coulomb forces with a range of the order of the inter electronic distance. The new subsidiary conditions act only on the electronic wave functions; they strongly inhibit long wavelength electronic density fluctuations and act to reduce the number of individual electronic degrees of freedom by n′. The general properties of this system are discussed, and the methods and results obtained are related to the classical density fluctuation approach and Tomonaga's one-dimensional treatment of the degenerate Fermi gas.},

By a series of canonical transformations it is shown that under suitable circumstances (which obtain in nearly all solids) plasmons (a quantized collective plasma oscillation of the electron gas) represent a well-defined elementary excitation of the solid. The "existence criterion" for plasmons is found to be a high electronic polarizability. Where plasmons exist, we are able to give a satisfactory description of their properties when the majority of the individual electron oscillator strengths correspond to transitions in which the energy change is large or small with respect to the plasmon energy, \hbar \omega p=\hbar(4{ \pi N e}2m)12. After the plasmon modes are separated out, the remaining electron interaction is found to be screened, with a range of the order of the interelectronic spacing. The usefulness of this effective Hamiltonian for the calculation of the electronic energy levels and cohesive energy in solids is discussed briefly.},

	doi = {10.1088/0959-5309/49/4S/307},
	abstract = {Attention is drawn to a class of semi-conductors or insulators with incompletely filled 3d bands. Their lack of conductivity, if the number of electrons per atom is an integer, is explained by the circumstance that a moving electron will have a large probability of being withdrawn to the initial atom, if only the potential barriers to be penetrated are sufficiently high to reduce the frequency of transition below a certain limit. This inhibiting factor disappears, if for ions of equal electronic levels the number of electrons per atom differs from an integer. In the case of {NiO} this condition is fulfilled if an electron is brought by thermal excitation from the lattice 3d band into the somewhat raised and less occupied levels a, a' (figure 1); these levels belong to Ni ions adjacent to a vacant Ni lattice point introduced by the deviations from stoichiometry, and two of these Ni ions are at the absolute zero Ni3+ ions. An analogous conduction mechanism holds for non-stoichiometric Cu2O, with a completely filled 3d band (figure 2).
Photoconductivity is generally observed with substances with completely filled zones and never with substances of the {NiO} type. A tentative explanation is given for this fact on the basis of the model of figure 1 and figure 2.
In non-stoechiometric {ZnO} vacant oxygen lattice points are assumed (figure 3); in that case the calculation of the lattice levels shows that at the lattice holes one Zn2+ is converted into Zn, whereas in the lattice the additional electrons form Zn+ ions, as will be the case after thermal transitions of the electrons belonging to these Zn atoms into the lattice 4s band.},

	abstract = {We discuss a new method to perform numerical simulations of one-dimensional systems with fermion and boson degrees of freedom. The method is based on a direct-space, imaginary-time representation of the fermion field. It is fast so that systems having up to 100 sites can easily be simulated. In addition, the method provides an intuitive physical "picture" of the ground state of a one-dimensional many-body system. We discuss in detail how to implement the method and how to compute various physical quantities. In particular, we show how to extend the method to study averages of off-diagonal quantities in an occupation-number representation. To assess the accuracy of our procedure, we apply it to free fermions in one dimension and compare with exact results. We then study a model of spinless interacting fermions and obtain the expected phase structure and behavior of correlation functions. We also consider the extended Hubbard model at various points in its phase diagram and study the behavior of spin-density, charge-density, and pairing correlation functions. We then study the Gross-Neveu model and show how the behavior depends on the number of fermion flavors. Finally, we consider an electron-phonon model and study its behavior both in the one-particle polaron sector and in the half-filled-band case. Along the way we show pictures of the ground-state configurations that give physical insight into the properties of the systems, like charge-density-wave, spin-density-wave, and superconducting states, "fractional charges," and solitons. We conclude by comparing our method with other methods and discuss the possibility of extending it to higher dimensions.},

Yet, topological superconductors are rare to date. Here we propose to realize spinless fermions by splitting the spin degeneracy in momentum space. Specifically, we identify monolayer hole-doped transition metal dichalcogenide ({TMD})s as candidates for topological superconductors out of such momentum-space-split spinless fermions. Although electron-doped {TMDs} have recently been found superconducting, the observed superconductivity is unlikely topological because of the near spin degeneracy. Meanwhile, hole-doped {TMDs} with momentum-space-split spinless fermions remain unexplored. Employing a renormalization group analysis, we propose that the unusual spin-valley locking in hole-doped {TMDs} together with repulsive interactions selectively favours two topological superconducting states: interpocket paired state with Chern number 2 and intrapocket paired state with finite pair momentum. A confirmation of our predictions will open up possibilities for manipulating topological superconductors on the device-friendly platform of monolayer {TMDs}.},

To date, nanodots/nanoislands have been regularly observed, while controlled fabrication of {TMD} nanoribbons remains challenging. Here we report a bottom-up fabrication of {MoSe}2 nanoribbons using molecular beam epitaxy, via an unexpected temperature-induced morphological phase transition from the nanodot to nanoribbon regime. Such nanoribbons are of zigzag nature, characterized by distinct chemical and electronic properties along the edges. The phase space for nanoribbon growth is narrowly defined by proper Se:Mo ratios, as corroborated experimentally using different Se fluxes, and supported theoretically using first-principles calculations that establish the crucial role of the morphological reconstruction of the bare Mo-terminated edge.

	abstract = {The recent emergence of two-dimensional layered materials -- in particular the transition metal dichalcogenides -- provides a new laboratory for exploring the internal quantum degrees of freedom of electrons and their potential for new electronics. These degrees of freedom are the real electron spin, the layer pseudospin, and the valley pseudospin. New methods for the quantum control of the spin and these pseudospins arise from the existence of Berry phase-related physical properties and strong spin-orbit coupling. The former leads to the versatile control of the valley pseudospin, whereas the latter gives rise to an interplay between the spin and the pseudospins. Here, we provide a brief review of both theoretical and experimental advances in this field.},

These correlations are accompanied by a dominant low-energy peak in the local spectral function and we propose that this can be used to detect edge-state magnetism by scanning tunneling microscopy. The dynamic spin structure factor at the edge of a ribbon exhibits an approximately linearly dispersing collective magnonlike mode at low energies that decays into Stoner modes beyond the energy scale where it merges into the particle-hole continuum.},

Our results show that for chiral ribbons of sufficient width, the spin correlations exhibit exceedingly long correlation lengths, even between zigzag segments that are well separated by periodic armchair regions. Characteristic enhancements in the magnetic correlations for distinct ribbon widths and chiralities are associated with energy gaps in the tight-binding limit of such ribbons. We identify specific signatures in the local density of states and low-energy modes in the local spectral function which directly relate to enhanced electronic correlations along graphene nanoribbons.

Increasing the relative strength of nonlocal interactions with respect to the on-site repulsion does not generate a phase transition but has a number of nontrivial effects. At the single-particle level we observe a marked enhancement of the Fermi velocity at the Dirac points. At the two-particle level, spin- and charge-density-wave fluctuations compete. As a consequence, the edge magnetic moment is reduced but the edge dispersion relation increases in the sense that the single-particle gap at momentum q=π/{\textbar}a1{\textbar} grows. We attribute this to nonlocal charge fluctuations which assist the spin fluctuations to generate the aforementioned gap. In contrast, the net result of the interaction-induced renormalization of different energy scales is a constant spin-wave velocity of the edge modes. However, since the particle-hole continuum is shifted to higher energies—due to the renormalization of the Fermi velocity—Landau damping is reduced. As a result, a roughly linear spin-wave-like mode at the edge spreads out through a larger part of the Brillouin zone.},

To investigate this phenomenon, we study a minimal electronic model of {FeSe}, with interactions that enhance nematic fluctuations. This model is sign problem free, and is simulated using determinant quantum Monte Carlo ({DQMC}). We developed a {DQMC} algorithm with parallel tempering, which proves to be an efficient source of global updates and allows us to access the region of strong interactions. Over a wide range of intermediate couplings, we observe superconductivity with an extended s-wave order parameter, along with enhanced, but short-ranged, q=(0,0) ferro-orbital (nematic) order. These results are consistent with approximate weak-coupling treatments that predict that nematic fluctuations lead to superconducting pairing. Surprisingly, in the parameter range under study, we do not observe nematic long-range order. Instead, at stronger coupling an unusual insulating phase with q=(π,π) antiferro-orbital order appears, which is missed by weak-coupling approximations.},

In this article, we review the status of the understanding of metallic quantum criticality, and the recent progress made by {QMC} simulations. We focus on the cases of spin density wave and Ising nematic criticality. We describe the results obtained so far, and their implications for superconductivity, non-Fermi liquid behavior, and transport in the vicinity of metallic quantum critical points.

Solutions to these issues can be found in terms of a complexification of the auxiliary fields. This implementation of the {HQMC} that does not attempt to regularize the fermionic matrix so as to circumvent the aforementioned singularities does not outperform single spin flip determinantal methods with cubic scaling. On the other hand we will argue that there is a set of models for which the {HQMC} is very efficient. This class is characterized by effective actions free of singularities. Using the Majorana representation, we show that models such as the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian at half filling and on a bipartite lattice belong to this class.

	abstract = {Topological insulators present a bulk gap, but allow for dissipationless spin transport along the edges. These exotic states are characterized by the \$Z\_2\$ topological invariant and are protected by time-reversal symmetry. The Kane-Mele model is one model to realize this topological class in two dimensions, also called the quantum spin Hall state. In this review, we provide a pedagogical introduction to the influence of correlation effects in the quantum spin Hall states, with special focus on the half-filled
Kane-Mele-Hubbard model, solved by means of unbiased determinant quantum Monte Carlo ({QMC}) simulations. We explain the idea of identifying the topological insulator via \${\textbackslash}pi\$-flux insertion, the \$Z\_2\$ invariant and the associated behavior of the zero-frequency Green's function, as well as the spin Chern number in parameter-driven topological phase transitions. The examples considered are two descendants of the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model, the generalized and dimerized Kane-Mele-Hubbard model. From the \$Z\_2\$ index, spin Chern numbers and the Green's function behavior, one can observe that correlation effects induce shifts of the topological phase boundaries. Although the implementation of these topological quantities has been successfully employed in {QMC} simulations to describe the topological phase transition, we also point out their limitations as well as suggest possible future directions in using numerical methods to characterize topological properties of strongly correlated condensed matter systems.},

A comparison of {DQMC} results with exact diagonalization and cluster perturbation theory studies elucidates how these different numerical techniques complement one another to produce a more complete understanding of the model and the cuprates. Interestingly, our {DQMC} simulations predict a charge-transfer gap that is significantly smaller than the direct (optical) gap measured in experiment.

	abstract = {We studied the possibility of exciton condensation in a strongly correlated bilayer extended Hubbard model using determinant quantum Monte Carlo. To model both the on-site repulsion U and the interlayer interaction V we introduced an update scheme extending the standard Sherman-Morrison update. We observe that the sign problem increases dramatically with the inclusion of the interlayer interaction V, which prohibits at this stage an unequivocal conclusion regarding the presence of exciton condensation. However, enhancement of the interlayer tunneling results suggest that the strongest exciton condensation tendency lies around 10–20\% p/n doping. Magnetic properties and conductivity turn out to be relatively independent of the interlayer interaction.},

Superconductivity in this geometry has previously been studied by a variety of analytic and numeric methods, with differing conclusions concerning whether the pairing correlations and transition temperature are raised near half filling by the inhomogeneous hopping or not. For U/t=4, {DQMC} indicates an optimal t′/t≈0.4 at which the pairing vertex is most attractive. The optimal t′/t increases with U/t. We then contrast our results for this plaquette model with a hamiltonian which instead involves a regular pattern of site energies whose large site energy limit is the three-band {CuO}2 model; we show that there the inhomogeneity rapidly, and monotonically, suppresses pairing.},

We analyze these thermodynamic behaviors based on energy scales in the density and spin channels. In the density channel, the interaction strength that marks the crossover from the weak to strong interaction regimes increases with the number of fermion components. In the spin channel, increasing the number of fermion components enhances quantum spin fluctuations, which is shown in the simulations of uniform spin susceptibilities and antiferromagnetic structure factors.},

They show that including the next-nearest-neighbor hopping term, which was often neglected in previous studies, in the Hubbard model leads to nearly half-filled spin stripes upon hole-doping, while no stripes upon electron-doping.

A self-contained, unified treatment of nonrelativistic many-particle systems, this text offers a solid introduction to procedures in a manner that enables students to adopt techniques for their own use. Its discussions of formalism and applications move easily between general theory and direct use by offering illustrations of principles to specific cases. Chapters on second quantization and statistical mechanics introduce students to ground-state (zero-temperature) formalism, which is explored by way of Green’s functions and field theory (fermions), Fermi systems, linear response and collective modes, and Bose systems. Finite-temperature formalism is examined through field theory at finite temperature, physical systems at finite temperature, and real-time Green’s functions and linear response. Additional topics cover canonical transformations and applications to physical systems in terms of nuclear matter, phonons and electrons, superconductivity, and superfluid helium as well as applications to finite systems. Graduate students will find this text enormously practical in making the transition from taking courses in quantum mechanics to interpreting the vast quantity of literature concerning the many-body problem.},

The order of the system and integer L are adjustable. Also adjustable is the conditioning of the coefficient matrix to give rise an extreme ill-conditioned system. Two numerical methods based on the {QR} decomposition with column pivoting and the singular value decomposition, respectively, are studied in this paper. It is proved that the computed solution x∼ by each of the methods is weakly backward stable in the sense that the computed x∼ is close to the exact solution of a nearby linear system[In+({BL}+Δ{BL})⋯(B2+ΔB2)(B1+ΔB1)]x∼=bwith each ΔBi small in norm relatively to Bi.},

	abstract = {Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo ({DQMC}) simulation has been widely used to reveal macroscopic properties of strong correlated materials. However, parallelization of the {DQMC} simulation is extremely challenging duo to the serial nature of underlying Markov chain and numerical stability issues. We extend previous work with novelty by presenting a hybrid granularity parallelization ({HGP}) scheme that combines algorithmic and implementation techniques to speed up the {DQMC} simulation. From coarse-grained parallel Markov chain and task decompositions to fine-grained parallelization methods for matrix computations and Green's function calculations, the {HGP} scheme explores the parallelism on different levels and maps the underlying algorithms onto different computational components that are suitable for modern high performance heterogeneous computer systems. Practical techniques, such as communication and computation overlapping, message compression and load balancing are also considered in the proposed {HGP} scheme. We have implemented the {DQMC} simulation with the {HGP} scheme on an {IBM} Blue Gene/P system. The effectiveness of the new scheme is demonstrated through both theoretical analysis and performance results. Experiments have shown over a factor of 80 speedups on an {IBM} Blue Gene/P system with 1,014 computational processors.},

	title = {A Fast Selected Inversion Algorithm for Green's Function Calculation in Many-Body Quantum Monte Carlo Simulations},
	doi = {10.1109/IPDPS.2016.69},
	abstract = {The Hubbard Hamiltonian provides a theoretical framework for describing electron interactions of quantum many-body systems in condensed matter physics. Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo ({DQMC}) simulations of the Hubbard Hamiltonian have contributed greatly to understanding important properties of materials. Physical measurements such as superconductivity and magnetic susceptibility are based on selected entries of a large set of Green's functions. The computations of Green's functions are equivalent to computing selected blocks of the inverses of large p-cyclic matrices. The performance of the state-of-art algorithm for computing Green's functions is around 100 Gflops on a 12-core Intel "Ivy Bridge" processor. In this paper, we describe a fast selected inversion ({FSI}) algorithm for computing selected entries of Green's functions and present a parallel implementation using hybrid {MPI}/{OpenMP} programming. The {FSI} algorithm rests on three ideas: (1) applying a block cyclic reduction for a structure-preserving reduction, (2) computing the inverse of the reduced block p-cyclic matrix by a structured orthogonal factorization, (3) using the block entries of the inverse of the reduced block p-cyclic matrix as seeds to rapidly form the selected inversion in parallel. Performance results of the new {FSI} algorithm on Edison, National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center ({NERSC})'s Cray {XC}30 supercomputer, show an 80\% improvement to 180 Gflops on the Intel "Ivy Bridge" processor. The parallel applications of the {FSI} algorithm for computing selected entries of multiple Green's functions reach to 20 – 30 Tflops on 100 compute nodes with 2400 cores. The preliminary results show that the {FSI} algorithm speeds up a full {DQMC} simulation of the Hubbard Hamiltonian by a factor of five, reducing from three and a half hours down to only forty minutes on the l2-core processor.},

	doi = {10.1038/natrevmats.2017.33},
	abstract = {Graphene is very popular because of its many fascinating properties, but its lack of an electronic bandgap has stimulated the search for 2D materials with semiconducting character. Transition metal dichalcogenides ({TMDCs}), which are semiconductors of the type {MX} 2, where M is a transition metal atom (such as Mo or W) and X is a chalcogen atom (such as S, Se or Te), provide a promising alternative. Because of its robustness, {MoS} 2 is the most studied material in this family. {TMDCs} exhibit a unique combination of atomic-scale thickness, direct bandgap, strong spin-orbit coupling and favourable electronic and mechanical properties, which make them interesting for fundamental studies and for applications in high-end electronics, spintronics, optoelectronics, energy harvesting, flexible electronics, {DNA} sequencing and personalized medicine. In this Review, the methods used to synthesize {TMDCs} are examined and their properties are discussed, with particular attention to their charge density wave, superconductive and topological phases. The use of {TMCDs} in nanoelectronic devices is also explored, along with strategies to improve charge carrier mobility, high frequency operation and the use of strain engineering to tailor their properties. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

The Dirac electrons behave in unusual ways in tunneling, confinement, and the integer quantum Hall effect. The electronic properties of graphene stacks are discussed and vary with stacking order and number of layers. Edge (surface) states in graphene depend on the edge termination (zigzag or armchair) and affect the physical properties of nanoribbons. Different types of disorder modify the Dirac equation leading to unusual spectroscopic and transport properties. The effects of electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in single layer and multilayer graphene are also presented.},
