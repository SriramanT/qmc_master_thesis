We start with an overview of the Hubbard model and in the following chapters we provide details on how to simulate it numerically using quantum Monte Carlo. In particular, we discuss the original motivation to introduce the model and show how the Hubbard Hamiltonian arises as an approximate representation of the Coulomb repulsion between electrons. Then, we present exact solutions for particular limiting cases, which can be used to crosscheck our simulations. In particular, we show that the effective Hamiltonian at half filling, in the limit where the interaction is large, corresponds to an atomic Heisenberg model defined in the appropriate Hilbert space with one electron per site. Finally, we show how the Hubbard model appears as a description of electron correlations in a TMD nanoribbon, and we perform a mean field calculation that shall be compared with the results of our simulations.
