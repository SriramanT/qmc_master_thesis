We start with a brief review of the Monte Carlo method in statistical physics, and then explain how the fundamental concepts we present can be generalized to study quantum-many fermion systems.
Focusing on the auxiliary field method, we discuss the mapping to the free-fermion problem that reduces the problem to the evaluation of determinants, and show how an efficient algorithm can be designed by successive global updates of the free-fermion Green's functions.
Then, we explain how to control the instabilities in this update scheme.
In particular, we explain how to circumvent low temperature instabilities due to the ill-conditioning of the matrices representing the free-fermion propagators.
We also show that this problem has to do with the coexistence of significantly different energy scales, and tends to get worse as the size increases.
Finally, we compute the estimators allowing the measurement of some relevant observables for \acp{TMDNR}.
