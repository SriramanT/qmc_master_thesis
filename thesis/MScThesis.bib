abstract = {We show that solutions to fermion sign problems in the CT-INT formulation can be extended to systems involving fermions interacting with dynamical quantum spins. While these sign problems seem unsolvable in the auxiliary field approach, solutions emerge in the worldline representation of quantum spins. Combining the idea with meron-cluster methods, we are able to extend the solvable models even further. We demonstrate these novel solutions to sign problems by considering several examples of strongly correlated systems.},

We then discuss the simulation algorithm used and compare simulation results with exact results for 6-site chains to test the reliability of the approach. We present results for thermodynamic properties and correlation functions for lattices up to 8{\&}{\&}8 in spatial size. The system is found to be an antiferromagnetic in-sulator for all values of the coupling constant at zero temperature in the half-filled-band case, but the long-range order is much smaller than predicted by mean-field theory. We perform a finite-size-scaling analysis to determine the character of the transition at zero coupling. For non-half-filled-band cases, our results suggest that the system is always paramagnetic, in contradiction with Hartree-Fock predictions. The system does not show tendency to ferromagnetism nor triplet super-conductivity in the parameter range studied. We also discuss some properties of the attractive Hub-bard model in the half-filled-band case.},

abstract = {We perform projective quantum Monte Carlo simulations of zigzag graphene nanoribbons within a realistic model with long-range Coulomb interactions. Increasing the relative strength of nonlocal interactions with respect to the on-site repulsion does not generate a phase transition but has a number of nontrivial effects. At the single-particle level we observe a marked enhancement of the Fermi velocity at the Dirac points. At the two-particle level, spin- and charge-density-wave fluctuations compete. As a consequence, the edge magnetic moment is reduced but the edge dispersion relation increases in the sense that the single-particle gap at momentum {\$}q=\backslashpi/|{\{}\backslashpmb a{\}}{\_}1|{\$} grows. We attribute this to nonlocal charge fluctuations which assist the spin fluctuations to generate the aforementioned gap. In contrast, the net result of the interaction-induced renormalization of different energy scales is a constant spin-wave velocity of the edge modes. However, since the particle-hole continuum is shifted to higher energies---due to the renormalization of the Fermi velocity---Landau damping is reduced. As a result, a roughly linear spin-wave-like mode at the edge spreads out through a larger part of the Brillouin zone.},

abstract = {Topological insulators present a bulk gap, but allow for dissipationless spin transport along the edges. These exotic states are characterized by the {\$}Z{\_}2{\$} topological invariant and are protected by time-reversal symmetry. The Kane-Mele model is one model to realize this topological class in two dimensions, also called the quantum spin Hall state. In this review, we provide a pedagogical introduction to the influence of correlation effects in the quantum spin Hall states, with special focus on the half-filled Kane-Mele-Hubbard model, solved by means of unbiased determinant quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. We explain the idea of identifying the topological insulator via {\$}\backslashpi{\$}-flux insertion, the {\$}Z{\_}2{\$} invariant and the associated behavior of the zero-frequency Green's function, as well as the spin Chern number in parameter-driven topological phase transitions. The examples considered are two descendants of the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model, the generalized and dimerized Kane-Mele-Hubbard model. From the {\$}Z{\_}2{\$} index, spin Chern numbers and the Green's function behavior, one can observe that correlation effects induce shifts of the topological phase boundaries. Although the implementation of these topological quantities has been successfully employed in QMC simulations to describe the topological phase transition, we also point out their limitations as well as suggest possible future directions in using numerical methods to characterize topological properties of strongly correlated condensed matter systems.},

abstract = {Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of fermions are hampered by the notorious sign problem whose most striking manifestation is an exponential growth of sampling errors with the number of particles. With the sign problem known to be an NP-hard problem and any generic solution thus highly elusive, the Monte Carlo sampling of interacting many-fermion systems is commonly thought to be restricted to a small class of model systems for which a sign-free basis has been identified. Here we demonstrate that entanglement measures, in particular the so-called Renyi entropies, can intrinsically exhibit a certain robustness against the sign problem in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo approaches and possibly allow for the identification of global ground-state properties via their scaling behavior even in the presence of a strong sign problem. We corroborate these findings via numerical simulations of fermionic quantum phase transitions of spinless fermions on the honeycomb lattice at and below half-filling.},

Static and dynamical properties are analyzed for nanoribbons of varying width and edge chirality, and compared to a self-consistent Hartee-Fock mean-field approximation. Our results show that for chiral ribbons of sufficient width, the spin correlations exhibit exceedingly long correlation lengths, even between zigzag segments that are well separated by periodic armchair regions. Characteristic enhancements in the magnetic correlations for distinct ribbon widths and chiralities are associated with energy gaps in the tight-binding limit of such ribbons. We identify specific signatures in the local density of states and low- energy modes in the local spectral function which directly relate to enhanced electronic correlations along graphene nanoribbons and which can be accessed scanning tunneling spectroscopy.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

This result is attained by making use of a diagrammatic method of analysis of the perturbation series. By a process analogous to the elimination of photon self-energy parts from the electrodynamic S matrix it is found possible to simplify the perturbation series, introducing a modified interaction between the particles. A useful integral equation for this modified interaction can be set up, and it is shown how the energy of the system can be expressed in terms of the modified interaction. The close connexion between this approach and the dielectric theory of plasma oscillations is indicated.},

Simulations complement experiments and model calculations in the effort to get insight into complex systems such as materials, complex liquids, or complicated molecules. As such, computer simulations are a strongly interdisciplinary field where chemistry meets physics, biology, and material science. Most simulations are based on classical physics because the interaction between atoms or even larger entities can be modeled accurately with classical mechanics for most problems as long as no chemical reactions are involved. If the interaction between atoms in a molecule or between molecules is to be calculated, for instance, to obtain parameters for modeling the interactions in classical simulations, classical physics has to be abandoned because these interactions involve the electron distributions which require a quantum mechanical description. {\{}$\backslash$copyright{\}} 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.

Yet, topological superconductors are rare to date. Here, we propose to realize spinless fermions by splitting the spin-degeneracy in momentum space. Specifically, we identify monolayer hole-doped transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)s as candidates for topological superconductors out of such momentum-space-split spinless fermions. Although electron-doped TMDs have recently been found superconducting, the observed superconductivity is unlikely topological due to the near spin-degeneracy. Meanwhile, hole-doped TMDs with momentum-space-split spinless fermions remain unexplored. Employing a renormalization group analysis, we propose that the unusual spin-valley locking in hole-doped TMDs together with repulsive interactions selectively favors two topological superconducting states: inter-pocket paired state with Chern number 2 and intra-pocket paired state with finite pair-momentum. A confirmation of our predictions will open up possibilities for manipulating topological superconductors on the device friendly platform of monolayer TMDs.},

To date, nanodots/nanoislands have been regularly observed, while controlled fabrication of TMD nanoribbons remains challenging. Here we report a bottom-up fabrication of MoSe2 nanoribbons using molecular beam epitaxy, via an unexpected temperature-induced morphological phase transition from the nanodot to nanoribbon regime. Such nanoribbons are of zigzag nature, characterized by distinct chemical and electronic properties along the edges. The phase space for nanoribbon growth is narrowly defined by proper Se:Mo ratios, as corroborated experimentally using different Se fluxes, and supported theoretically using first-principles calculations that establish the crucial role of the morphological reconstruction of the bare Mo-terminated edge.

abstract = {To treat interacting quantum systems, it is often crucial to have accurate calculations beyond the mean-field level. Many-body simulations based on field-theoretical approaches are a promising tool for this purpose and are applied in several sub-fields of physics, in closely related forms. An major difficulty is the sign or phase problem, which causes the Monte Carlo variance to increase exponentially with system size. We address this issue in the context of auxiliary-field simulations of realistic electronic systems in condensed matter physics. We show how to use importance sampling of the complex fields to control the phase problem. An approximate approach is formulated with a trial determinant to constrain the paths in field space and completely eliminate the growth of the noise. For ab initio electronic structure calculations, this gives a many-body approach in the form of a "coherent" superposition of mean-field calculations, allowing direct incorporation of state-of-the-art technology from the latter (non-local pseudopotentials; high quality basis sets, etc.). In our test calculations, single Slater determinants from density functional theory or Hartree-Fock calculations were used as trial wave functions, with no additional optimization. The calculated dissociation energies of various molecules and the cohesive energy of bulk Si are in excellent agreement with experiment and are comparable to or better than the best existing theoretical results. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We report large scale determinant Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the effective bandwidth, momentum distribution, and magnetic correlations of the square lattice fermion Hubbard Hamiltonian at half-filling. The sharp Fermi surface of the non-interacting limit is significantly broadened by the electronic correlations, but retains signatures of the approach to the edges of the first Brillouin zone as the density increases. Finite size scaling of simulations on large lattices allows us to extract the interaction dependence of the antiferromagnetic order parameter, exhibiting its evolution from weak coupling to the strong coupling Heisenberg limit. Our lattices provide improved resolution of the Green's function in momentum space, allowing a more quantitative comparison with time-of-flight optical lattice experiments.},

abstract = {We discuss the problems that arise in the numerical simulation of many-electron systems when the measure of the functional integrals is not positive definite. We present theoretical arguments and numerical data which indicate that the expectation value of the sign of the measure decreases exponentially as the inverse temperature P increases, unless the measure is forced to be positive by an explicit symmetry. We therefore conclude that a recent proposal for dealing with the sign problem due to Sorella et al. leads to an uncontrolled approximation. In the cases we have studied it is a good approximation for the ground-state energy, and we present a method for calculating the correction needed to make it exact. However, for some physical quantities, such as the d-wave pair field susceptibility, the neglect of signs can yield misleading results.},

abstract = {The recent emergence of two-dimensional layered materials — in particular the transition metal dichalcogenides — provides a new laboratory for exploring the internal quantum degrees of freedom of electrons and their potential for new electronics. These degrees of freedom are the real electron spin, the layer pseudospin, and the valley pseudospin. New methods for the quantum control of the spin and these pseudospins arise from the existence of Berry phase-related physical properties and strong spin–orbit coupling. The former leads to the versatile control of the valley pseudospin, whereas the latter gives rise to an interplay between the spin and the pseudospins. Here, we provide a brief review of both theoretical and experimental advances in this field.},

Electrons in graphene, obeying a linear dispersion relation, behave like massless relativistic particles. This results in the observation of a number of very peculiar electronic properties - from an anomalous quantum Hall effect to the absence of localization - in this, the first two-dimensional material.

abstract = {We report on a numerical study of the two-dimensional Hubbard model and describe two new algorithms for the simulation of many-electron systems. These algorithms allow one to carry out simulations within the grand canonical ensemble at significantly lower temperatures than had previously been obtained and to calculate ground-state properties with fixed numbers of electrons. We present results for the two-dimensional Hubbard model with half- and quarter-filled bands. Our results support the existence of long-range antiferromagnetic order in the ground state at half-filling and its absence at quarter-filling. Results for the magnetic susceptibility and the momentum occupation along with an upper bound to the spin-wave spectrum are given. We find evidence for an attractive effective d-wave pairing interaction near half-filling but have not found evidence for a phase transition to a superconducting state.},

abstract = {One of the core problems in materials science is how the interactions between electrons in a solid give rise to properties like magnetism, superconductivity, and metal-insulator transitions? Our ability to solve this central question in quantum statistical mechanics numerically is presently limited to systems of a few hundred electrons. While simulations at this scale have taught us a considerable amount about certain classes of materials, they have very significant limitations, especially for recently discovered materials which have mesoscopic magnetic and charge order. In this paper, we begin with an introduction to the Hub- bard model and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The Hubbard model is a simple and effective model that has successfully cap- tured many of the qualitative features of materials, such as tran- sition metal monoxides, and high temperature superconductors. Because of its voluminous contents, we are not be able to cover all topics in detail; instead we focus on explaining basic ideas, concepts and methodology of quantum Monte Carlo simulation and leave various part for further study. Parts of this paper are our recent work on numerical linear algebra methods for quantum Monte Carlo simulations.},

abstract = {The remarkable properties of graphene have renewed interest in inorganic, two-dimensional materials with unique electronic and optical attributes. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are layered materials with strong in-plane bonding and weak out-of-plane interactions enabling exfoliation into two-dimensional layers of single unit cell thickness. Although TMDCs have been studied for decades, recent advances in nanoscale materials characterization and device fabrication have opened up new opportunities for two-dimensional layers of thin TMDCs in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics. TMDCs such as MoS(2), MoSe(2), WS(2) and WSe(2) have sizable bandgaps that change from indirect to direct in single layers, allowing applications such as transistors, photodetectors and electroluminescent devices. We review the historical development of TMDCs, methods for preparing atomically thin layers, their electronic and optical properties, and prospects for future advances in electronics and optoelectronics.},

@article{Booth2009,
abstract = {We have developed a new quantum Monte Carlo method for the simulation of correlated many-electron systems in full configuration-interaction (Slater determinant) spaces. The new method is a population dynamics of a set of walkers, and is designed to simulate the underlying imaginary-time Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation of the interacting Hamiltonian. The walkers (which carry a positive or negative sign) inhabit Slater determinant space, and evolve according to a simple set of rules which include spawning, death and annihilation processes. We show that this method is capable of converging onto the full configuration-interaction (FCI) energy and wave function of the problem, without any a priori information regarding the nodal structure of the wave function being provided. Walker annihilation is shown to play a key role. The pattern of walker growth exhibits a characteristic plateau once a critical (system-dependent) number of walkers has been reached. At this point, the correlation energy can be measured using two independent methods—a projection formula and a energy shift; agreement between these provides a strong measure of confidence in the accuracy of the computed correlation energies. We have verified the method by performing calculations on systems for which FCI calculations already exist. In addition, we report on a number of new systems, including CO, O 2 , CH 4 , and NaH—with FCI spaces ranging from 10 9 to 10 14 , whose FCI energies we compute using modest computational resources.},

@article{Al-Saidi2006,
abstract = {Calculations of the binding energy of the transition metal oxide molecules TiO and MnO are presented, using a recently developed phaseless auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo approach. This method maps the interacting many-body problem onto a linear combination of non-interacting problems by a complex Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, and controls the phase/sign problem with a phaseless approximation relying on a trial wave function. It employs random walks in Slater determinant space to project the ground state of the system, and allows use of much of the same machinery as in standard density functional theory calculations, such as planewave basis and non-local pseudopotentials. The calculations used a single Slater determinant trial wave function obtained from a density functional calculation, with no further optimization. The calculated binding energies are in good agreement with experiment and with recent diffusion Monte Carlo results. Together with previous results for sp-bonded systems, the present study indicates that the phaseless auxiliary field method is a robust and promising approach for the study of correlation effects in real materials.},

@article{McKay2011,
abstract = {Optical lattices have emerged as ideal simulators for Hubbard models of strongly correlated materials, such as the high-temperature superconducting cuprates. In optical lattice experiments, microscopic parameters such as the interaction strength between particles are well known and easily tunable. Unfortunately, this benefit of using optical lattices to study Hubbard models comes with one clear disadvantage: the energy scales in atomic systems are typically nanokelvin compared with kelvin in solids, with a correspondingly miniscule temperature scale required to observe exotic phases such as d-wave superconductivity. The ultra-low temperatures necessary to reach the regime in which optical lattice simulation can have an impact—the domain in which our theoretical understanding fails—have been a barrier to progress in this field. To move forward, a concerted effort is required to develop new techniques for cooling and, by extension, techniques to measure even lower temperatures. This paper will be devoted to discussing the concepts of cooling and thermometry, fundamental sources of heat in optical lattice experiments, and a review of proposed and implemented thermometry and cooling techniques.},

abstract = {We investigate the edge-state magnetism of graphene nanoribbons using projective quantum Monte Carlo simulations and a self-consistent mean-field approximation of the Hubbard model. The static magnetic correlations are found to be short ranged. Nevertheless, the correlation length increases with the width of the ribbon such that already for ribbons of moderate widths we observe a strong trend towards mean-field-type ferromagnetic correlations at a zigzag edge. These correlations are accompanied by a dominant low-energy peak in the local spectral function and we propose that this can be used to detect edge-state magnetism by scanning tunneling microscopy. The dynamic spin structure factor at the edge of a ribbon exhibits an approximately linearly dispersing collective magnonlike mode at low energies that decays into Stoner modes beyond the energy scale where it merges into the particle-hole continuum.},

In this process the Green's function emerges as a fundamental tool, since it is used in the updating process, and, at the same time, it is directly related to the quantities probing magnetic, charge, metallic, and superconducting behaviours.
