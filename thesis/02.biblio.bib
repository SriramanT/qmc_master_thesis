abstract = {Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, while being efficient for bosons, suffer from the "negative sign problem" when applied to fermions--causing an exponential increase of the computing time with the number of particles. A polynomial time solution to the sign problem is highly desired since it would provide an unbiased and numerically exact method to simulate correlated quantum systems. Here we show that such a solution is almost certainly unattainable by proving that the sign problem is nondeterministic polynomial (NP) hard, implying that a generic solution of the sign problem would also solve all problems in the complexity class NP in polynomial time.},

Starting with the basic ingredients of Monte Carlo simulations for classical systems, we introduce aspects such as importance sampling, sources of errors, and finite-size scaling analyses. We then set up the preliminary steps to prepare for the simulations, showing that they are actually carried out by sampling discrete Hubbard-Stratonovich auxiliary fields. In this process the Green's function emerges as a fundamental tool, since it is used in the updating process, and, at the same time, it is directly related to the quantities probing magnetic, charge, metallic, and superconducting behaviours. We also discuss the as yet unresolved "minus-sign problem", and two ways to stabilize the algorithm at low temperatures.},

The usual Hamiltonian corresponding to a system of individual electrons with Coulomb interactions is first re-expressed in such a way that the long-range part of the Coulomb interactions between the electrons is described in terms of collective fields, representing organized "plasma" oscillation of the system as a whole. The Hamiltonian then describes these collective fields plus a set of individual electrons which interact with the collective fields and with one another via short-range screened Coulomb interactions. There is, in addition, a set of subsidiary conditions on the system wave function which relate the field and particle variables.

Increasing the relative strength of nonlocal interactions with respect to the on-site repulsion does not generate a phase transition but has a number of nontrivial effects. At the single-particle level we observe a marked enhancement of the Fermi velocity at the Dirac points. At the two-particle level, spin- and charge-density-wave fluctuations compete. As a consequence, the edge magnetic moment is reduced but the edge dispersion relation increases in the sense that the single-particle gap at momentum {\$}q=\backslashpi/|{\{}\backslashpmb a{\}}{\_}1|{\$} grows. We attribute this to nonlocal charge fluctuations which assist the spin fluctuations to generate the aforementioned gap. In contrast, the net result of the interaction-induced renormalization of different energy scales is a constant spin-wave velocity of the edge modes. However, since the particle-hole continuum is shifted to higher energies---due to the renormalization of the Fermi velocity---Landau damping is reduced. As a result, a roughly linear spin-wave-like mode at the edge spreads out through a larger part of the Brillouin zone.},

@article{Hsu2017,
abstract = {Theoretically it has been known that breaking spin-degeneracy and effectively realizing 'spinless fermions' is a promising path to topological superconductors. Yet, topological superconductors are rare to date. Here, we propose to realize spinless fermions by splitting the spin-degeneracy in momentum space. Specifically, we identify monolayer hole-doped transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)s as candidates for topological superconductors out of such momentum-space-split spinless fermions. Although electron-doped TMDs have recently been found superconducting, the observed superconductivity is unlikely topological due to the near spin-degeneracy. Meanwhile, hole-doped TMDs with momentum-space-split spinless fermions remain unexplored. Employing a renormalization group analysis, we propose that the unusual spin-valley locking in hole-doped TMDs together with repulsive interactions selectively favors two topological superconducting states: inter-pocket paired state with Chern number 2 and intra-pocket paired state with finite pair-momentum. A confirmation of our predictions will open up possibilities for manipulating topological superconductors on the device friendly platform of monolayer TMDs.},

abstract = {Magnetic materials and nanostructures based on carbon offer unique opportunities for future technological applications such as spintronics. This article reviews graphene-derived systems in which magnetic correlations emerge as a result of reduced dimensions, disorder and other possible scenarios. In particular, zero-dimensional graphene nanofragments, one-dimensional graphene nanoribbons, and defect-induced magnetism in graphene and graphite are covered. Possible physical mechanisms of the emergence of magnetism in these systems are illustrated with the help of computational examples based on simple model Hamiltonians. In addition, this review covers spin transport properties, proposed designs of graphene-based spintronic devices, magnetic ordering at finite temperatures as well as the most recent experimental achievements.},

abstract = {Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a family of van der Waals layered materials exhibiting unique electronic, optical, magnetic and transport properties. Their technological potentials hinge critically on the ability to achieve controlled fabrication of desirable nanostructures, such as nanoribbons and nanodots. To date, nanodots/nanoislands have been regularly observed, while controlled fabrication of TMD nanoribbons remains challenging. Here we report a bottom-up fabrication of MoSe2 nanoribbons using molecular beam epitaxy, via an unexpected temperature-induced morphological phase transition from the nanodot to nanoribbon regime. Such nanoribbons are of zigzag nature, characterized by distinct chemical and electronic properties along the edges. The phase space for nanoribbon growth is narrowly defined by proper Se:Mo ratios, as corroborated experimentally using different Se fluxes, and supported theoretically using first-principles calculations that establish the crucial role of the morphological reconstruction of the bare Mo-terminated edge. The growth mechanism revealed should be applicable to other TMD systems.},

Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are layered materials with strong in-plane bonding and weak out-of-plane interactions enabling exfoliation into two-dimensional layers of single unit cell thickness. Although TMDCs have been studied for decades, recent advances in nanoscale materials characterization and device fabrication have opened up new opportunities for two-dimensional layers of thin TMDCs in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics. TMDCs such as MoS(2), MoSe(2), WS(2) and WSe(2) have sizable bandgaps that change from indirect to direct in single layers, allowing applications such as transistors, photodetectors and electroluminescent devices. We review the historical development of TMDCs, methods for preparing atomically thin layers, their electronic and optical properties, and prospects for future advances in electronics and optoelectronics.},

  abstract={Attention is drawn to a class of semi-conductors or insulators with incompletely filled 3 d bands. Their lack of conductivity, if the number of electrons per atom is an integer, is explained by the circumstance that a moving electron will have a large probability of being withdrawn to the initial atom, if only the potential barriers to be penetrated are sufficiently high to reduce the frequency of transition below a certain limit. This inhibiting factor disappears, if for ions of equal electronic levels the number of electrons per atom differs from an integer. In the case of NiO this condition is fulfilled if an electron is brought by thermal excitation from the lattice 3 d band into the somewhat raised and less occupied levels a, a ' (figure 1); these levels belong to Ni ions adjacent to a vacant Ni lattice point introduced by the deviations from stoichiometry, and two of these Ni ions are at the absolute zero Ni 3+ ions. An analogous conduction mechanism holds for non-stoichiometric Cu 2 O, with a completely filled 3 d band (figure 2). Photoconductivity is generally observed with substances with completely filled zones and never with substances of the NiO type. A tentative explanation is given for this fact on the basis of the model of figure 1 and figure 2. In non-stoechiometric ZnO vacant oxygen lattice points are assumed (figure 3); in that case the calculation of the lattice levels shows that at the lattice holes one Zn 2+ is converted into Zn, whereas in the lattice the additional electrons form Zn + ions, as will be the case after thermal transitions of the electrons belonging to these Zn atoms into the lattice 4 s band.}

  abstract={It is shown that the collective electron and London-Heitler models are not to be regarded as different approximations to the same exact wave function for solids in which, according to the former model, there is a partially filled zone of energy levels. It can thus be shown why nickel oxide in the pure state is a non-conductor, although it contains an incomplete zone. The properties of the metals nickel, palladium and platinum are discussed in the light of these results; platinum differs from nickel in that the orbital contribution to the moment of the elementary magnets is not quenched. A discussion is given of x-ray absorption edges, and it is shown why exciton lines are absent for metals.}

We also review in detail the more sophisticated DMC algorithm within the fixed-node approximation, introduced to avoid the infamous Fermionic sign problem, which allows one to sample a more accurate approximation to the ground-state wave function. Throughout this review, we discuss the statistical methods used for evaluating expectation values and statistical uncertainties.

Our ability to solve this central question in quantum statistical mechanics numerically is presently limited to systems of a few hundred electrons. While simulations at this scale have taught us a considerable amount about certain classes of materials, they have very significant limitations, especially for recently discovered materials which have mesoscopic magnetic and charge order. In this paper, we begin with an introduction to the Hub- bard model and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The Hubbard model is a simple and effective model that has successfully cap- tured many of the qualitative features of materials, such as tran- sition metal monoxides, and high temperature superconductors. Because of its voluminous contents, we are not be able to cover all topics in detail; instead we focus on explaining basic ideas, concepts and methodology of quantum Monte Carlo simulation and leave various part for further study. Parts of this paper are our recent work on numerical linear algebra methods for quantum Monte Carlo simulations.},
