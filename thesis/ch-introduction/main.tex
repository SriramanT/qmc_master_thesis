The isolation of graphene in 2004 has led to a growing interest of the scientific community in \ac{2D} materials revealing extraordinary properties.
Among them, are \acp{TMD} nanostructures, which are examples of systems where electrons are strongly correlated, and one cannot neglect the interactions between them.
The increased complexity of the models describing such materials, compared to their graphene counterparts, calls for sophisticated computer simulation methods.
A numerical treatment is required to solve these problems since analytical approaches are either hopeless, or rely on unrealistic approximations.
In this introductory chapter, we start by  reviewing the literature on the physics of \acp{TMD}, focusing on their basic properties.
Then, we present a survey of simulation methods belonging to the \acl{QMC} class to introduce some basic concepts, and motivate the choice of the particular method we used.
Finally, we summarize our original contributions, and outline the structure of the thesis.
