The isolation of graphene in 2004 has led to a growing interest of the scientific community in \ac{2D} materials revealing extraordinary properties.
Among them are \acp{TMD}, appearing in the form of a variety of nanostructures.
Unlike in graphene, where electron interactions are relatively weak, in \acp{TMD}, electrons are strongly correlated, and one cannot overlook the interactions between them.
Analytical approaches to the solution of the problem are either hopeless, or rely on possibly unrealistic approximations.
In fact, the increased complexity of the models describing such highly correlated  materials, compared to their graphene counterparts, calls for sophisticated computer simulation methods, most notably \ac{QMC}.
In this introductory chapter, we start by  reviewing the literature on the physics of \acp{TMD}, focusing on their basic properties.
Then, we present a survey of simulation methods belonging to the \acl{QMC} class.
We introduce some basic concepts, and motivate the choice of the particular used  method.
Finally, we summarize our original contributions, and outline the structure of the thesis.
