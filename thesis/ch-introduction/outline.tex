\section{Outline}
\label{sec:int_outline}

We started this introductory chapter with the concept of emergence in strongly correlated electron systems.
Then, we proceeded to discuss the particular example, which we will tackle in this thesis: the \acs{2D} \acs{TMD} nanoribbon.
In this system, electron correlations give rise to interesting forms of magnetism, which, as far as we know, were unexplored numerically before this work.
To tackle this interacting fermion system, we resort to a  state-of-the-art algorithm that has been in continuous development over the last 30 years.
