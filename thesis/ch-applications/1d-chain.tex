\section{One-dimensional Chain}
\label{sec:1d-chain}

The main result of the analytical solution of the \acs{1D} Hubbard model is that there is no Mott transition.
The system remains an insulator down to $U \rightarrow 0$, and becomes a conductor only at $U = 0$.
Thus, we expect antiferromagnetic order to appear for high enough $\beta$.
We can identify it by studying the spin-spin correlation function, and Fourier transforming to obtain a peak at $q = \pi$ in the magnetic structure factor $S ( q ) $.
