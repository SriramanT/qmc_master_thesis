In this chapter, we start by benchmarking and comparing our code with other implementations.
We simulate the Hubbard model in \acs{1D} and on the \acs{2D} square lattice, for which results are well established from either an analytical or numerical perspective.
Then, we consider the honeycomb lattice with both periodic and nanoribbon boundary conditions.
We compare the obtained results and the run time with other flagship implementations.
Finally, we carry out original calculations, applying our code to a minimal model of \acs{TMD} nanoribbons.
We compare our \acs{QMC} results with those obtained by us in the mean field (MF)  approximation.
The latter is formulated allowing a site and orbital-dependent mean field, and the self-consistency relation is solved iteratively.
We characterize the convergence issues arising in this iterative procedure.
Our original MF results, supported by our unbiased \acs{QMC} simulations show that in the model we consider, \acs{TMD} nanoribbons host edge-magnetism at finite temperature.
The obtained phase diagram shows  transitions between non-magnetized and two distinct edge-magnetized configurations.
