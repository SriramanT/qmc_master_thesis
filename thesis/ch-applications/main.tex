In this chapter, we benchmark and compare our code with other implementations by simulating the Hubbard model in \acs{1D} and on the \acs{2D} square lattice, for which results are well established from either an analytical or numerical perspective.
Then, we consider the honeycomb lattice with both periodic and nanoribbon boundary conditions.
Finally, we carry out original calculations, applying our code to a minimal model of \acs{TMD} nanoribbons.
We compare our \acs{QMC} results with those also obtained by us in the mean field approximation.
The latter is formulated allowing a site and orbital-dependent mean field, and the self-consistency relation is solved numerically.
We characterize the convergence issues arising in this iterative procedure.
