\section{Square lattice}
\label{sec:square}

The case of the square lattice is extensively studied both at the mean field level and using \acs{QMC}.
Mean field results suggest that at half filling,  antiferromagnetic order persists even at weak coupling \cite{claveau_mean-field_2014, gouveia_magnetic_2015}, a result that we confirm with \acs{QMC}, reproducing the results of \cite{white_numerical_1989, hirsch_two-dimensional_1985}.
