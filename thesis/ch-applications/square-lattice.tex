\section{Square lattice}
\label{sec:square}

The case of the square lattice is extensively studied, notably in \cite{white_numerical_1989}.
Mean field results suggest that at half filling,  antiferromagnetic order persists even at weak coupling \cite{claveau_mean-field_2014}, a result that we confirm with \ac{QMC}, reproducing the results of \cite{white_numerical_1989}.
