\section{Honeycomb lattice}
\label{sec:honeycomb}

This type of geometry is important because of this model's realization in graphene.
Moreover, it is interesting to compare these results with those for nanoribbons, which have different boundary conditions, and, in the case of \acp{TMD}, multi-orbital nonuniform hoppings between sites of one of the sublattices (the $M$-atom sublattice).
