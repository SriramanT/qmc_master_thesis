# IST Thesis Template

This is a template for a MSc thesis in IST, University of Lisbon. It was downloaded from

_*https://github.com/themiguelamador/ThesisIST*_

and modified by me in the spring of 2018.

At the time of writing, I am using Mendeley for reference management. I am also using biber as the backend for biblatex.

I made a few changes to the template. Most notably, I divided the folder in 4 types: _*all*_ , _*beg*_ , _*ch*_ , and _*end*_ . They are pretty self explanatory. 

To update my references automatically, I used the path to the references *_.bib*_ file as the Dropbox folder in my computer. At the end of the thesis, one must uncomment the line

*_\addbibresource{MScThesis.bib}*_ in the file *_beg-definitions/packages.tex_*

after copying the relevant references to *_MScThesis.bib_*.

The path for the figure is set to *_all-figures_*. The sub-folders within this folder are the names of the chapters starting with a capital, i.e. 'Hubbard' instead of 'hubbard' (to avoid mistaking them for the ch-folders themselves).
