# IST Thesis Template

This is a template for a MSc thesis in IST, University of Lisbon. It was downloaded from

_*https://github.com/themiguelamador/ThesisIST*_

and modified by me in the spring of 2018.

At the time of writing, I am using Zotero for reference management. I am also using biber as the backend for biblatex.

I made a few changes to the template. Most notably, I divided the folder in 4 types: _*all*_ , _*beg*_ , _*ch*_ , and _*end*_ . They are pretty self explanatory.

The path for the figure is set to *_all-figures_*. The sub-folders within this folder are the names of the chapters starting with a capital, i.e. 'Hubbard' instead of 'hubbard' (to avoid mistaking them for the ch-folders themselves).
